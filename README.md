Proto packages for Presidio API
===========================

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/csedevil/Presidio/_apis/build/status/Presidio-genproto?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/csedevil/Presidio/_build/latest?definitionId=57?branchName=master)

This repository contains the generated GO and Python packages for [Presidio]
(https://github.com/microsoft/presidio) API, and the generated [gRPC](https://grpc.io) code necessary for interacting with Presidio's gRPC services
APIs.

# Changing Presidio's API
First, set up a Presidio development environment. For more info, see Presidio's development document (https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/edit/master/docs/development.md)

Presidio leverages [protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) to create API classes and services across multiple environments.

Follow these steps to change Presidio's API:
1. Fork the [presidio-genproto](https://github.com/Microsoft/presidio-genproto) repo into `YOUR_ORG/presidio-genproto`
2. Clone the repo into the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/YOUR_ORG/presidio-genproto` folder
3. Make the desired changes to the .proto files in /src
4. [Install the specific grpcio-tools and protobuf versions](install.md)
5. Generate the Go and Python files. Run the following commands in the `src` folder of `presidio-genproto`:

    ```sh
    python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I . --python_out=../python --grpc_python_out=../python ./*.proto

    protoc -I . --go_out=plugins=grpc:../golang ./*.proto
    ```
    
 5. Copy all the files in the `python` folder into `presidio-analyzer/analyzer`. All generated files end with `*pb2.py` or `*pb2_grpc.py`
 6. Change the constraint on `Gopkg.toml` which directs to the location of `presidio-genproto`
From:

```yaml
[[constraint]]
  branch = "master"
  name = "github.com/Microsoft/presidio-genproto"
```

To:

```yaml
[[constraint]]
  branch = "YOUR_GENPROTO_BRANCH"
  name = "github.com/YOUR_ORG/presidio-genproto"

```
  7. Update `Gopkg.lock` by calling `dep ensure` or `dep ensure --update github.com/YOUR_ORG/presidio-genproto`
  8. Push all the changes (generated python files, `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` into your presidio repo
